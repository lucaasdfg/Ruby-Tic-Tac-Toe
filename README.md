# Ruby-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe Game using OOP with ruby

## open the terminal and type this
git clone git@github.com:lucaasdfg/Ruby-Tic-Tac-Toe.git 


## this shoud create the project
now type: ruby main.rb


## Classical Tic-Tac-Toe in the terminal
we have a 3X3 grid, with column 1-2-3 and rows a-b-c to choose which bracket we write the row a and the column 1
so == a1 

## what we had to do
Plan the project, the board the game logic and the way to check who wins

Build the game 

check if it works

## OOP
we used classes and methods to write and make the game work 


# intructions 
1: write: ruby main.rb on the terminal
2: write the name of the 2 players
3: select which cell with the letter of the row and the number of the column
4: enjoy!

# how to play
you have to make a row or a column of the symbol you have is either O : X
so to win you just need 3 of the same aligned in row column or diagonal
